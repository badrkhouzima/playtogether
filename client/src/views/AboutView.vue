    <h1>Collaborate on Building a Playground Connection Web App for Families</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to our playground matching web app! This project is a
      collaborative effort by junior web developers to expand their skills and
      work together towards a common goal. Our app is designed to connect
      families and create meaningful playtime experiences for children. As a
      junior web developer, you will have the opportunity to contribute to the
      development of this app and expand your skills in a supportive and
      collaborative environment. By working together with other junior
      developers, you will be able to gain experience with real-world projects,
      build your portfolio, and improve your coding abilities. Our app is
      designed to help parents find nearby playgrounds and connect with other
      families in their community. Our goal is to provide a safe and fun
      environment for children to make new friends, learn social skills, and
      engage in physical activity. With our app, parents can search for
      playgrounds in their district and post when they are planning to visit,
      allowing other families to see when they can join in and meet new friends.
      We believe that the early years are critical for a child's development,
      and that playtime with other children is an essential part of that
      development. Our app aims to support and encourage meaningful play
      experiences for children, helping them to build social skills, develop
      physical coordination, and learn through play. Your contributions to this
      project will be maintained in the dev branch of our Github repository. We
      welcome your ideas, suggestions, and contributions, and look forward to
      working with you to build a great app that benefits families and children
      in your community. Thank you for choosing to participate in this project,
      and we look forward to your contributions!
